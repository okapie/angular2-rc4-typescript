## How to build

I use json-server as a fake API.

In this case, json-server is used for listing "Funny guy" character.

Don't try to run with "npm run json-server" because it doesn't work currently.

Try to run the following command.

```
sudo json-server --port 2050 test/fixture/db.json
```

Webpack has a web server called webpack-dev-server.

when we run the webpack command, webpack run dev server.

It also rebuilds bundle when any of files change and browser refreshes automatically.

From the command line, run the following command.

```
npm run server
```

Why license is CC ? Because all character is designed by my-self.

They are unique design by illustrating from scratch.
